      <h2>Talon</h2>
      <p>Talon is the knife in the darkness, a merciless killer able to strike without warning and escape before any alarm is raised. He carved out a dangerous reputation on the brutal streets of Noxus, where he was forced to fight, kill, and steal to survive. Adopted by the notorius Du Couteau family, he now plies his deadly trade at the empire's command, assassinating enemy leaders, captains, and heroes... as well as any Noxian foolish enough to earn the scorn of their masters.</p>

When Talon basic attacks a fully wounded target, they bleed for 80-280 (+2.1 per bonus attack damage) physical damage over 2 seconds (levels 1-11). Talon's abilities will also wound all monsters for 110% damage.</p>
